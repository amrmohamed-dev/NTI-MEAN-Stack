# NTI MEAN Stack Diploma

This repository contains a collection of **tasks, demos, and mini projects** developed during the **NTI MEAN Stack Diploma** program.

The projects focus on building strong foundations in **web development concepts**, problem-solving, and practical application of programming logic through real-world scenarios.

Each task is implemented as a **standalone project**, with its own structure and implementation details, while following a clean and organized approach across the repository.

## 🛠️ Tasks Overview

### 🎓 Task 01 – Student Management System

A system for managing student records and grades, including data validation, searching, statistics calculation, and dynamic table rendering.

---

### 🛒 Task 02 – Shopping Cart System

An interactive shopping cart simulation implementing structured data handling, user interaction workflows, state persistence, and UI feedback mechanisms.

A dedicated README is included for this task with detailed explanation and demo usage instructions.

---

### 🏆 Task 03 – Student Bonus System

A grading and bonus management system that focuses on data validation, conditional logic, performance evaluation, and visual feedback based on calculated results.
